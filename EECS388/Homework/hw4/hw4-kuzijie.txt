# Problem 2

2a. In the source code provided, The following code is written:
    "GET {0}{1} HTTP/1.1{5}Host: {3}{5}User-Agent: {2}{5}Accept:..."
    This is actually the HTTP v1.1 GET request with different paramenters,
    such as delay time, protocol type, frequency and etc.
    The idea behind this attack is that, repeated request is sent from a
    single client or a pool of client in a high frequency. Those huge
    amount of network traffic will flood the server buffers. As a result, 
    LOIC achieve a DoS attack. Furthermore, since LOIC allows many hosts
    to join the botnet, this results a Distributed DoS attack from all over 
    the Internet.
2b. The IRC-based "Hive Mind" mode enables a LOIC user to connect his or her
    copy of LOIC to an IRC channel in order to receive a target and other 
    attack parameters via an IRC topic message. Users can voluntarily give
    up the control of their machine to a contrally controlled server.
2c. 1. blacklist known compromized IP addresses.
    2. filter out protocols that not needed. 
       e.g. discard ftp request if server only hosts web service.
    3. disable too frequent requests from a single host with the same IP.
    4. use CAPTCHA as sort of challenge similar to client puzzles. 
       post some sort of challenge problem to filter out hosts with wrong
       solution or no solution. 
2d. According to wikipedia, Operation Payback was a coordinated, decentralized
    group of attacks on high profile opponents of Internet piracy by Internet
    activists using the "Anonymous" moniker.
