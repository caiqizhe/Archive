# Problem 1

1a. The only way the client could do this is by brute forcing the solution
    since HMAC is a one-way function. Let total number of hash value has
    total m bit. Then, we have total 2^(M-n) possible solutions. 
    Then, we have p = 2^(m-n)/2^(m) = 2^(-n) to guess the solution right. 
    Then, the expected number of computation is just the expected value
    of a geometric random variable which has the expected value = 1/p.
    Then, we would expect 2^(n) computations to get n bits. 
1b. Let 2^(n) = 64 => n = 6. Hence, as long as n >= 6 then, it will cost
    attacker more to attack the server. 
1c. Case 1: suppose the server is not under attack, the server can set n to 
    less than 6. 
    Case 2: if the server is under attack, a process that is similar 
    to auction could be implemented. A more challenging problem such as
    n >> 6 (much greater than 6) will be send to client. This will require
    much more computing power from the client. Client with more computing 
    power will be able to complete the challenge faster, hence receive the 
    service from server sooner.    
    The difficulty level could be adjusted based on the workload of the server.
    If the server is more loaded, the upcoming requests will be harder to 
    compute.  

# Problem 2

2a. In the source code provided, The following code is written:
    "GET {0}{1} HTTP/1.1{5}Host: {3}{5}User-Agent: {2}{5}Accept:..."
    This is actually the HTTP v1.1 GET request with different paramenters,
    such as delay time, protocol type, frequency and etc.
    The idea behind this attack is that, repeated request is sent from a
    single client or a pool of client in a high frequency. Those huge
    amount of network traffic will flood the server buffers. As a result, 
    LOIC achieve a DoS attack. Furthermore, since LOIC allows many hosts
    to join the botnet, this results a Distributed DoS attack from all over 
    the Internet. Stop flooding the server if try block fails and throws
    an exception to the catch block in bw_DoWork(). 
    The "finally{ IsFlooding=false; }" will terminate the process and back 
    on task if the application receives responds from server again after
    certain time intervals.
2b. The IRC-based "Hive Mind" mode enables a LOIC user to connect his or her
    copy of LOIC to an IRC channel in order to receive a target and other 
    attack parameters via an IRC topic message. Users can voluntarily give
    up the control of their machine to a centralizes controlled server.
2c. 1. server stop responding to the request if it receives a large 
       volume of the identical request in a short period of time.
    2. filter out invalid requests.
       e.g. discard ftp request if server only hosts web service.
    3. disable too frequent requests from a single host with previously seen IP.
    4. use CAPTCHA as sort of challenge similar to client puzzles. 
       post some sort of challenge problem to filter out hosts with wrong
       solution or no solution.
    5. blacklist known compromized IP addresses.
2d. Hactivists using the "Anonymous" moniker using modified version of LOIC attack
    on high profile opponents of Internet privacy organizations, such as Visa, BoA,
    Paypal.This kind of attacks are usually coordinated, planned and decentralized
    DDoS attacks.
2e. Christopher Wayne Cooper is one of the hactivist member of "Anonymous". 
    He was arrested for alleged participation in a series of DDoS attacks
    against PayPal between August 1 2010 and January 22 2011 trying to stop 
    PayPal doing business with WikiLeaks.
2f. Botnet is very similar to LOIC Hive Mind mode in a sense that a collection
    of Internet-connected programs communicating with other similar programs
    to perform tasks. The programs could be used to send spams or participate in
    DDoS attacks.
    However, the difference is that Botnet usually involves a pool of compromized
    computer to perform any attacks. The compromized hosts usually perform tasks 
    without being notified whereas in LOIC Hive Mode involves a pool of computers
    that are voluntarily joined the IRC channel.
2g. LOIC Hive mode is similar to a political protest that organizations like
    "Anonymous" could organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions
    heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy. The LOIC
    Hive mode is like a protest in cyber space where many hosts join the channel 
    voluntarily. However, it is also different from a political protest because 
    each individuals involve in a protest may express his or her individual opinion.
    But this may not be true for LOIC Hive mode. LOIC client are controlled to join
    the DDoS attack like in Operation Pay-back. The host running LOIC client may not
    be aware of the abuse.
